To start server manually:

Open the terminal and navigate to:

/home/pi/ALARM

Next, we need to start an instance of virtualenv which is
our virtual environment:

. venv/bin/activate

(to deactivate this mode, simply type deactivate)

Next, navigate back to the directory where the python 
file to be executed is located. When there, type:

export FLASK_APP=filename.py

then,

flask run --host=filesname.py
