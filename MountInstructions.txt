If samba client is not installed run the following in the terminal:

apt-get install samba-common smbclient samba-common-bin smbclient cifs-utils

Next, a local directory needs to be created for the mount point as follows:

mkdir /localLocation/MountPoint

To mount the server shared folder you will then type the following:

mount -t cifs //server/share /localLocation/MountPoint

where server is the computer or server's name or netbios. MountPoint is going to be the folder you created above on your local machine.

If there is a password you must do the following when trying to mount instead of the above step:

mount -t cifs //server/share /localLocation/MountPoint -o user=user,pass=password,dom=domain

To unmount simply type:

umount /localLocaion/MountPoint

NOTE:**** The above is lowercase uMount, not uNMount
